title: Biography
---

I am experienced in development of web applications in both backend (PHP, MySQL) and frontend (JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js) environments. So far I took part in improving web application optimization, REST APIs

integration, legacy code refactoring and improvement, SQL query optimization and adding new features to old projects.

I'm passionate about routine work optimization and automation. I try to do my best to avoid useless time spending for manual work. I'm always interested in modern technologies. I try to spend my free time studying new frameworks and techniques in web development.Before starting programming I prefer to study project details to avoid ambiguities. I can use any communication service for your convenience but prefer Skype, Slack and email. Normally I use Bitbucket to store the source code. Of course I can use any other version control system depending on project requirements.
